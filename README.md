# AppleModule5Assignment

This is the read me for the AppleModeule5Assignment. In this assignment we'll focus on a bot that's able to track how many apples one has eaten, and how much their body has bennifited and or delclined from the intake of such excessive nutrients. 


### Hypothetical Apple sharing feature

We're gonna add new functionality to let you instantly share your apple tracking results to your friends so that you can inform them of your apple superiority and 
tell them that they should eat more apples.

(This is the Q11 thing for Jacob Olson jdo227 btw)
